    <p id="tribute-info"><b>Subhas Chandra Bose </b>was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the high noon of the British Raj. 
        The early recipient of an unusually Anglocentric education, his teenage and young adult years were interspersed with brilliant academic success, oversize religious yearning, and stark rebellion against authority. 
        In a college in which his five brothers had preceded him, he was expelled for participating in an assault on a professor. He was also rusticated from the University of Calcutta, but after reinstatement 18 months later he managed to study blamelessly and excel academically. 
        Sent to England at his father's urging to take the Indian Civil Service examination, he succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the more routine but clinching final exam. He cited nationalism to be a higher calling than the civil service. 
        Returning to India in 1921 to join the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress, Bose at first worked with C. R. Das in Bengal. He flowered under Das's mentorship.
         He then followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress. 
         The group was younger, less keen on constitutional reform, and more open to socialism.
         Bose rose precociously to become Congress president in 1938. 
         After reelection in 1939, differences arose between Bose and Gandhi. 
         The senior leadership in the Congress supported Gandhi, and Bose resigned as president, and was eventually ousted from the party
          In July 1940, Bose was arrested by the Bengal government over a small protest, and later kept housebound under a strict police watch. 
          In mid-January 1941, he escaped from India in dramatic cloak-and-dagger fashion, heading northwestward into Afghanistan.</p>
